<h3><b><center><u>Probability and Statistics</u></b> </center></h3>
<p>Data can be represented in the form of graphs and charts. <br>
We have learnt <b>Pie Chart</b>, <b>Bar Graph</b>, <b>Pictograph</b> and <b>Probability</b> in this grade.<br>
<br>Data representation relates to analyzing data, grouping or ogranizing data to present it better. <br></b>

<b><u>Pie Chart</u></b> : In this type of representation, a Pie is divided into different parts where each part of the pie relates to unique data.</u></b> </p>

<b><u>Bar Graph</u></b> : This graphichal data representation is in the form of dual axis : x-axis and y-axis. The scale on x axis and y axis is divided into equal intervals and labelled accordingly. The graph can be given a title & each axis is labelled.<br>

<b><u>Pictograph</u></b> : This graphical data representation, has each picture/symbol which follows a similar legend and key is provided to decode it.The graph is titled and labelled to analyze the data.<br>
<img src="images/M_picto_img.png" alt="" data-position="top center" /><br>
<b><u>Probability</u></b> : This is data analysis. Interpreting data and finding the most likely/less likely/Impossible/unlikely and equal chance cases after data is analyzed.<br>
