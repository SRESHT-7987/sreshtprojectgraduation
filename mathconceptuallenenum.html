<b> Conceptual Lens for Number Sense   </b>
<ul><li>Form: Number has different forms as it can be written using different numeral systems - Indian, International, and Roman Number system. Also understood is the representation of numbers.
</li><li>
Function: The unit of each number changes the way we understand it. For example, 500 ml is much lesser than 500 l. Also, the length, breadth, height, weight, temperature, etc each are measured in different units which make their value unique when used.</li>
<li>Change: Converting one form to another and understanding how they are connected is very crucial. I happened to understand the conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius and also, Inches to Centimeters, etc. This makes our working much easier.</li></ul>

<b> Conceptual Lens for Probability and Statistics   </b>
 <ul><li>Form: Data is represented in a way for everyone's understanding. This is to help understand the data effectively and draw actuals out of it. To make it more meaningful, Title, legends, scale etc are added along with the Units for the data </li>
   <li>Perspective: Data is interpreted by the user by analyzing the legends, scale, intervals, etc and used for reflection activity
</li><li>Reflective: Data is understanding the events that might occur. It could be a less recurring event/more recurring event, no event at all, etc.</li></ul>

    <b> Conceptual Lens for Estimation   </b>
   <ul><li>Form: Data is analyzed based on previous pattern and a figurative value is obtained. </li>
    <li>Perspective: Estimated value is provided on the data that is a guess by the user </li></ul>
		<b> Conceptual Lens  For Patterns and Functions   </b>
 <ul><li>Form: Data is presented in various patterns and is analyzed to understand the hidden pattern. A pattern is represented using numbers, symbols, shapes, alphabets or a combination of any of them.
</li>
  <li>Connections: Data is interpreted by the user by connecting the given data, the patterns, recognizing the connection to the next patterns and missing patterns. </li></ul>
