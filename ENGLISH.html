												<h3>Identify reading styles </h3>
											</header>
											<p>There are 4 types of reading styles I have learnt those are<br>
												1. Passively<br> 2. Actively<br> 3. Deeply<br>4. Critical   </p>
											<p>
												<b>Comprehension</b> is the ability to understand something or the process of understanding something<br>
												What does inference means ?
Inference is a guess that you make an opinion that you form based on the information that you have.<br>
												An <b>inference</b> is an idea or conclusion that's drawn from evidence and reasoning. An inference is an educated guess..
<br>
When you make an inference, you're reading between the lines or just looking carefully at the facts and coming to conclusions.<br>
												<b>Extrapolate</b> means ..
<br>
To project, extend or expand (known data or experience) into an area not known or experienced so as to arrive at a usually conjectural knowledge of the unknown area.
<br>
To make connections from known to the unknown.

	Free Time !!!!! Something which everyone likes commonly but what is un-common is how one spends this free time. Some may have different pastimes - like watch movies  while others may want to play video games, etc  but for me, I like to play my guitar ! I got fascinated to learn one string instrument and was introduced to Guitar at the age of 8. Since then this has become a great part of my life. However, this passion of playing an instrument was induced in me from my brother. He is damn good at playing Keyboard ! My home always had the sounds of his Keyboard.<br>
	My first Guitar experience was on my teachers instrument which continued for a quite a few months. My parents bought me a Guitar after an year. I still remember that day when me and my parents went to pickup my Guitar. I instantly opened the bag and pulled out the instrument. It's a woodish and cream combination one. My heart was filled with so much joy and my eyes sparkled when I saw it. My teacher worked on the strings and handed over the Guitar to me. <br>
	I learnt several songs on my Guitar and gave 3 stage performances, which initially had technical glitches, but rectified in the later ones. My Guitar variant also has an electric point output through can connect external speakers which helped me immensely in my performances. My community recognises me as a Guitarist and this makes me feel proud when ever some body says me this !!<br>
	My parents and teacher supports me very well in this. Now, with a serious intention of getting certified, I am pursuing my Guitar from Rock studios. I want to continue my music journey and aim greater heights. So, please encourage me and wish me all the best !!! :) 	</p>
