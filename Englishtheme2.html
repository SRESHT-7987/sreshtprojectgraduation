<p>Yes, I am now 10- year old. My mom says, you have grown so fast. Is it so ? I still remember my pre-school days and they are just as fresh memories to me ! However, 10 years that means 10*365*24*60*60 seconds = 31,53,60,000 seconds I have lived and did I make most use of it ? If I look back, my learning journey has been amazing - be it at school, home or any other place. <br>So, lets now see how other humans who lived started evoluting from Stone age with many discoveries & inventions - Fire/Wheel/Motor, etc and now we are bringing technology on to each one's plate. Started with humans staying in jungle to huts to houses to multi-storeyed buildings/villas/mansions. Draping leaves to clothes of different materials our lives have changed much. While, communication & technology brought a gear shift in our lives.
We now use different electronic gadgets like mobiles/tabs/IOT devices to connect with 7 billion people in this world. Distance has become very very near. World seems small, as each of us connect and communicate very often. Each of us, think differently and some of us do have similar ideas. If I would dream a world 15 years from now, there could be lot of technological advancement made. <br>Virtual reality might be in each and every home. It would be soon that the knowledge we possess may become out-dated. Could also be that, we may soon make artificial ozone layer to protect earth from sun and meteorites. People might start habitat on Mars and explore other planets too. By 2030, I would be pursuing my graduation or any other field of my choice. But, I aim to become an IAS officer. However, there would be many people who would also attempt. So, I need to inherit some qualities that would help me build my base strong and crack the IAS and the interview too.<br> This would be important for me as in 2045, I would like to see myself being rewarded for my sincerity, dedication and share this happiness with all, including my immediate family reaping the benefits of my hardwork and planning for a better future for all. So, the way I and we organize ourselves would matter most.
