<center><h1>  <body> <b><u> Rivers of India</u> </b><br></h1></center>
<p> Rivers are the natural life lines for any country. India is blessed with several such rivers which provides Irrigational facilities and also power generation capability. Details about few of the many rivers India has are mentioned below .
<h3>
                                                <center>    Ganga</center> </h3>
<p><b>Origination:</b><br>The River Ganga, also known as River Ganges, crosses National and International borders of India and Bangladesh during its long extensive flow. Rising in the state of Uttarakhand in the Himalayas, it commences its 2,525 km journey eventually reaching the Bay of Bengal. Being the most sacred river to the Hindus, the Ganga is also a lifeline to millions of Indians who live along its course. Gomukh Gangotri Glacier is one of the primary sources of the Ganges.<br>
<b>Confluences:</b><br> It confluences with several rivers before merging with sea. They are:<br>

   <b>Alaknanda</b> river which starts from Satopanth glacier and joins river Bhagirathi to form the Ganges in Devprayag <br>
     <b> Yamuna</b> and the mythical <b>Saraswati</b> forming Triveni Sangam. Astonishingly, the three rivers are visibly different<br>
<b> Ghaghara river</b>, originating near Lake Manasarovar meets the Ganges at Doriganj.  finally, confluencing with Bay of Bengal<br>
<b>Dams:</b><br>
<b>Tehri Dam</b> across Ganges is the highest dam in India. It is also one of the highest dams in the world. It is of 260.5m in height and 575m in length and generates 1000MW of Hydroelectricity.<br>
<b>Bansagar Dam</b>  is a dam on Sone River, a tributary of Ganges. It is situated in the Ganges Basin. It is a multipurpose dam that provides both irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. <br>
<b> Farakka Barrage</b> is a barrage across the Ganges river located in the lower course of the river. It is of 2240m in length and enables diversion of water to sixty small canals for drinking purposes.



<h3> <center> Indus    </center></h3>
<b>Origination:</b><br> The source of Indus river is near Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar in the Kailash Range which forms part of the Trans Himalaya range in Tibet. It is fed by glaciers and rivers from the Himalayas. It is one of the longest rivers in Asia with a length of is 3,180 km.<br>
<b>Confluences:</b><br>The  river confluences with Zanskar River which originates from the Zanskar ranges and is a tributary of the Indus. At Mithankot, Indus confluences with the 5 Punjab rivers (Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas).
It finally flows into the Arabian Sea in Pakistan in the west & Rann of Kutch in the east forming the Indus river delta.<br>
<b>Dams: </b><br> The <b>Bhakra dam</b> built at a gorge near the Bhakra village, on Sutlej river(tributary of Indus)  is a tall and narrow structure designed for irrigation and hydroelectric generation. It is one of the highest gravity dams of the world standing at 741ft.<br>
The <b>Pong Dam</b> is an earth-fill embankment dam on the Beas River used for both irrigation and hydroelectric power generation. The dam site is at an elevation of 435.86 m above sea level in the upper course of the river.<br> The
<b>Harike Barrage</b> is is near the confluence of Satluj and Beas in Punjab and is the start of the Indira Gandhi Canal,which is one of the largest canal projects in India.<br>

<b>Dams:</b><br><b>Srisailam dam </b> is built across a deep gorge in the Nallamala hills. With awe inspiring length of 512mts, it generates a capacity of 1670 MW , the largest hydroelectric stations of the country.<br> <b>Balakwadi Dam</b> is a multi-purpose dam on river Krishna. The primary role of the dam is to supply water for agriculture, industries and drinking water. <b>Almatti Dam </b> is located in North Karnataka. It is used for both irrigation and hydroelectric power generation.<b>Nagarjunasagar Dam</b> was built at the point where the Krishna river forms the boundary between Nalgonda District in Telangana and Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh. It is among the earliest multi-purpose irrigation and hydro-electric dam projects in India.<br><b>Jurala Dam</b> also known as the Priyadarshini Project is located at a distance of 10 kilometers from Kuruvapur village in the Mahabubnagar district of Telangana. This is the only Hydroelectric project in Telangana which has water throughout the year, and this makes the dam nationally important.
<br><b>Prakasam Barrage</b>  is one of the first major irrigation projects of South India started in year 1852 and completed in 3yrs. <br><b>Pulichintala Dam</b>  is located in Pulichintala village in Guntur district. It is situated between between Prakasam Barrage at Vijayawada and the Nagarjuna Sagar dam.

                                            <center><b>    <h3>Godavari</h3></b> </center>

<b>Origination:</b><br> The Godavari river, second longest river in India after the Ganges,  is sometimes referred to as Dakshin Ganga. It is not a perennial river and is fed only through rainfall. Tributaries of Godavari make up 75% of the riverâ€™s catchment area and are crucial in extending the river flow beyond monsoon season. It has a length of 1465KM and emptys into the Bay of Bengal<br>
<b>Delta:</b><br> Godavari Delta is also called as Konaseema. The delta of Godavari consists of a wide belt of river borne alluvium formed by deposits at the mouth of the river over the years.<br><b>Dams:</b> <br> <b>Gangapur Dam</b> is an earthfill dam that was built in 1865 with the primary purpose of irrigation. The gross storage capacity is 215,880 cubic kilometers. Over a period of time the storage capacity of the dam has slowly come down. This is because of the silt deposition in the reservoir area. <br><b>Jayakwadi Dam</b> The main purpose of Jayakwadi dam is to irrigate land for agriculture in the drought prone Marathwada region of Maharashtra state. 80% of water of dam is meant for irrigation, 5-7% for drinking water and the rest for industrial purposes.The reservoir of Jayakwadi dam is called Nath Sagar.<br><b>Sriram sagar dam</b> serves for irrigation purposes & also generates electricity. This flood-flow project on the Godavari River, Provides irrigation to 1.64million acres.<br>
 <b> Dowleswaram Barrage</b> Sir Arthur Thomas Cotton built the Dowleswaram Barrage in the year 1850 and is primarily an irrigation structure.
