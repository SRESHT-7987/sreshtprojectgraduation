<p>
  Lets begin by understanding what the word organize means arranging in the best/optimal order. Here, planning & executing are implicit.<br> Organize refers to arranging stuff at home/school and also to timeliness. Organizing a day/week/month means to distribute time across all events happening in that duration. So, I prefer to plan an order for the events with the duration for each so that I balance my study time, play time and my actions are inclined. <br>This includes the way I organize my belongings to reduce time delay in searching for the required stuff.
  Our essential agreements have been modulated to fit this Virtual mode of learning.
 Wonder, how it is done at bigger institutions, government or school, how the staff work here collaboratively. <br>Same with hospitals, pharmaceuticals, banks, government, etc. All governing bodies should be completely organized to help the community. The works that are done by each of them have a huge impact on the greater living community. The Organization, reporting structure should be well versed with the way of operations. <br>The bodies come up with several initiatives and committees who will dedicate their time for fostering better living. When I take the example of Swachh Bharat, there would be a Committe who has surveyed and anticipated the consequences. While, other committee would have worked to form a structure for functioning and implementing the initiative. Another committee would have been formed to collect the statistics and report it. <br>Indeed, its a great country wide initiative in which most of the cities threw trash out of them to keep it clean.
 In every society, we do have such governing committee/body to frame the structure and implement solutions for betterment. <br>This will foster growth econimically and help the humankind with better jobs.
